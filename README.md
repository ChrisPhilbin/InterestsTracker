# Realationships

Assists managers/leaders in building real, meaningful relationships with their employees.

## Description

Employee experience (EX) is going to be at the forefront of many employerâ€™s business goals over the next several years in response to COVID-19 and the way it has impacted the way employees view work.  Relationships is a React on Rails app that sets out to allow managers to foster real, meaningful relationships with their employees by tracking things like the interests their employees have, what sports teams they like, any pets they have etc. NewsAPI is leveraged to curate a list of related articles to be used as talking points when the manager or leader interacts with their team members/peers.
